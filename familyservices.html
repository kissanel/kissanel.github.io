Young people can often find life challenging and overwhelming.
    	<br></br>
Some young people can be at risk of exclusion and feel hopeless about the future.
  	<br></br>
Some can avoid attending school or other experiences they find challenging leading to a restrictive life.
  	<br></br>
Others can find it difficult to navigate the challenges of the social and virtual world.

We are educational and child psychologists who work with school staff and families to create systems that
support all young people to develop the skills to face their challenges and to define and navigate their own
